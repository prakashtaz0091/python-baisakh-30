# Arithmetic Operators
# Addition ( + )
# print(2 + 3)

# # Subtraction ( - )
# print(2 - 3)

# # Multiplication ( * )
# print(2 * 3)

# # Division ( / )
# print(2 / 3)

# # Integer Division ( // )
# print(2 // 3)

# # Mod/Remainder ( % )
# print(2 % 3)

# # power ( ** )
# print(2**3)


# # for ex. Convert m to cm
# meter = 10
# cm = meter * 100
# print(cm)


# Relational Operators
# # Greater than ( > )
# print(2 > 3)

# # Less than ( < )
# print(2 < 3)

# # Equal to ( == )
# print(2 == 3)

# # Not equal to ( != )
# print(2 != 3)

# # Greater than or equal to ( >= )
# print(2 >= 3)

# # Less than or equal to ( <= )
# print(2 <= 3)


# Logical Operator
# AND ( and )
#     True  and True => True
# print(2 < 3 and 4 < 5)


# # OR ( or )
# #     True  or False => True
# print(2 < 3 or 4 > 5)

# # NOT ( not )
# #     not True => False
# print(not 2 < 3)


# String operator
# Concatenation ( + )
# firstname = "ram"
# lastname = "poudel"
# print(firstname + " " + lastname)
# print(f"Person's first name is {firstname} and last name is  {lastname}")


# # Repetition ( * )
# print("Ram" * 3)

# print("ram" + 2) # this is wrong/invalid because string can't be added with integer
# print(2 + "ram")


# Input statement
# name = input("Enter your name: ")
# age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
# print(
#     f"""
#     Your name is {name} and your age is {age}.
#     After 5 years your age will be {age + 5}.
#     And after 10 years your age will be {age + 10}
